# CCF Experiment Designer

## Core Rule

Design experiments that test the paper's central claims. Build result tables and evidence-bound figure specs only from supplied real values or explicit placeholders. Never fabricate numbers, improvements, significance, benchmark ranks, or user-study outcomes. Publication-grade layout, palette, caption placement, and render QA belong to `ccf-visual-composer`. Follow the user's requested output shape: experiment plan, table, LaTeX table, figure spec, ablation list, or execution queue.

## Modes

- `design`: datasets, baselines, metrics, ablations, robustness, efficiency, failure analysis, and execution priority.
- `result-template`: fill-in tables with `TBD` placeholders.
- `result-presentation`: result tables, figure evidence plans, chart specs, caption facts, and missing-value markers from supplied real results.

## Workflow

1. Identify target venue, paper type, central claims, available results, and whether the task is planning or presenting results.
2. Extract the storyline from the current idea/project record and the
   ScienceEvolve context index. If a storyline blueprint is already present in the
   project workspace, use it as a schema; do not require the Writing Agent's
   skill directory or create a writing handoff merely to design experiments.
3. Map every major claim to required evidence, reviewer question, dataset/workload, baseline, metric, ablation, and robustness/failure test.
4. If datasets or baselines are unknown, use public-safe search or hand off to `ccf-literature-searcher`; mark uncertainty instead of guessing.
5. Load `references/evidence-design.md` for venue-family expectations and `references/result-templates.md` for result tables.
6. For result presentation, preserve units, seeds, confidence intervals, dataset names, and metric direction. Mark missing values explicitly.
7. Hand off to `ccf-visual-composer` for publication-grade figure/table layout, palettes, panel maps, captions, manuscript integration, and render QA.
8. Hand off to `ccf-paper-writer` for manuscript prose, `ccf-integrity-auditor` for number/claim consistency, and `ccf-submission-checker` for package or artifact readiness.

## Adaptive Output Contract

Return the requested artifact first. For a result table request, output the table. For a figure request, output the evidence-bound figure spec and caption facts, then name `ccf-visual-composer` as next owner for visual composition when needed. For a full experiment-design request, use this default structure:

```text
Mode:
Venue and assumptions:
Claim-evidence matrix:
Dataset / benchmark needs:
Baseline matrix:
Main experiments:
Ablations:
Robustness / failure / efficiency:
Result tables or figure specs:
Missing values:
Execution priority:
No-fabrication status:
Next CCFA owner:
```
