# CCFA Routing

Route by the user's primary intent. Do not activate every downstream skill just because it may become useful later.

v0.7 consolidates helper skills into the owning workflow skills. Runtime surface is intentionally small: 16 installable `ccf-*` skills plus the LaTeX/template reference tree. Removed helper names must not be installed as standalone skills.

## Canonical Runtime Skills

| Intent | Owning skill | Included modes | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Create project folders, copy/select templates, initialize `ccfa.yaml`. | `ccf-project-scaffolder` | scaffold | Does not create research content. |
| Plan workflow, decompose tasks, coordinate stages/gates/handoffs. | `ccf-pipeline-orchestrator` | planning, status, gate | Does not perform downstream research work. |
| Explore, rescue, or turn a rough direction into a problem-gap-insight-method-evidence plan. | `ccf-idea-optimizer` | exploratory idea shaping, rescue routes | Does not rank multiple ideas as the main task. |
| Score, compare, rank, and triage early ideas when the user explicitly asks for judgment. | `ccf-idea-reviewer` | idea scoring, stage-aware triage | Does not brainstorm directions or optimize a single idea as the main task. |
| Monitor recent papers, arXiv/OpenReview/venue feeds, labs, competitors, and recurring novelty threats. | `ccf-literature-monitor` | arxiv-watch, venue-watch, novelty-check, trend-scouting, competitor-tracking | Does not replace deep related-work search, citation audit, or final idea scoring. |
| Search literature, prior art, datasets, benchmarks, citation evidence, and opportunity gaps. | `ccf-literature-searcher` | search, screening, opportunity map | Does not audit only already cited papers or act as a final idea kill gate. |
| Design experiments and real-result tables/figures. | `ccf-experiment-designer` | experiment design, result templates, result figures/tables | Does not invent results. |
| Compose publication-grade figures/tables, Python plotting code, palettes, captions, panel maps, and manuscript visual layout integration from supplied results. | `ccf-visual-composer` | visual-contract, figure-design, python-plotting, table-design, layout-integration, render-qa | Does not design experiments, invent results, write manuscript prose, or perform final submission compliance. |
| Draft, revise, polish, compress, and presentation-adapt paper text. | `ccf-paper-writer` | writing, polishing, compression, venue-aware LaTeX drafting, slides/poster/talk/Q&A | Preserves user format for edits; does not run full review or rebuttal. |
| Convert user-provided paper PDFs into reusable writing exemplar cards. | `ccf-paper-to-exemplar` | exemplar extraction, writing-pattern cards, custom exemplar registration | Does not write papers or perform review. |
| Review manuscripts scientifically and stylistically. | `ccf-paper-reviewer` | scientific review, writing review, format-facing review, AC/meta-review | Does not rewrite or rebut. |
| Audit evidence integrity, numbers, figures/tables, and existing citations. | `ccf-integrity-auditor` | claim audit, numeric audit, citation audit | Does not replace review or broad literature search. |
| Check venue rules, LaTeX/PDF package, anonymity, metadata, and artifacts. | `ccf-submission-checker` | venue format, package check, artifact/reproducibility | Does not polish content. |
| Write rebuttals, revision ledgers, response letters, and resubmission plans. | `ccf-rebuttal-writer` | rebuttal, revision ledger, response letter, resubmission | Does not trigger for ordinary writing. |
| Shared routing, source registry, privacy/evidence, artifact contracts. | `ccf-common` | governance | Not an ordinary research task skill. |
| Maintain skills, docs, SVG diagrams, routing, validation, and releases. | `ccf-skill-forger` | skill maintenance, docs/SVG maintenance, release validation | Does not do research writing or review. |

## Merged Capability Map

| Old standalone entry | Current owner | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ccf-workflow-planner` | `ccf-pipeline-orchestrator` | Planning and stage routing are one project-control responsibility. |
| `ccf-paper-compressor` | `ccf-paper-writer` | Compression changes manuscript text and must preserve writing scope. |
| `ccf-writing-reviewer` | `ccf-paper-reviewer` | Writing review and scientific review are review modes over the same manuscript. |
| `ccf-citation-auditor` | `ccf-integrity-auditor` | Citation verification is evidence integrity, not broad literature search. |
| `ccf-figure-table-builder` | `ccf-experiment-designer`, then `ccf-visual-composer` | Experiment designer owns evidence design and real result values; visual composer owns publication layout, palette, captions, and render QA. |
| `ccf-artifact-packager` | `ccf-submission-checker` | Artifact readiness is part of submission package readiness. |
| `ccf-venue-format-guide` | `ccf-submission-checker` | Venue format lookup is a submission/package gate; paper writing still reads venue references. |
| `ccf-resubmission-adapter` | `ccf-rebuttal-writer` | Resubmission follows review-response and revision-ledger ownership. |
| `ccf-paper-presenter` | `ccf-paper-writer` | Talks, posters, and Q&A are paper-derived writing outputs. |
| `ccf-doc-diagram-designer` | `ccf-skill-forger` | Documentation SVGs are repository maintenance, not research workflow. |

## Venue Layer Rule

Venue knowledge is reference material, not venue-specific runtime skills. Use:

- `ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/index.md`
- `ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/<venue>.md`
- `ccf-submission-checker` for venue format, template, page-limit, anonymity, and package questions

For manuscript writing from only an idea, `ccf-paper-writer` checks the venue
guide first and drafts in that venue's style when a venue is named. If no target
venue or format is named, it uses the default NeurIPS guide/template at
`ccf-latex-templates/NeurIPS/neurips_2026.tex`; user-supplied format always
takes precedence, while custom exemplars may guide prose without replacing the
template. ScienceEvolve Main decides whether a later venue or package check is needed.
