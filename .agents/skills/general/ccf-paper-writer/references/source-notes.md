# Source Notes

Use this file only when source provenance matters, when updating venue assumptions, or when explaining where exemplar records came from.

## Shared Registry

The authoritative CCFA source inventory is:

```text
../ccf-common/references/source-registry.yaml
```

Do not duplicate long URL lists in this skill. Human repository maintainers may
add or update public source records in the shared registry and run the
repository's source checks outside an ScienceEvolve role invocation. Writing agents
should treat the registry as read-only reference material and must not run
skill-forger/skill-creator validation as part of writing.

## Writing-Skill Use Rules

- Use source records only for provenance, venue-policy checks, exemplar source tracking, and update auditing.
- Use exemplar papers only to extract transferable writing moves: section structure, paragraph roles, claim-evidence patterns, figure/table narration, and reviewer-facing rhythm.
- Do not copy paper wording, claims, examples, technical content, or distinctive phrasing.
- Before a real submission, verify the target venue's current author instructions, review criteria, page limits, anonymity policy, supplementary material rules, artifact policy, and ethics requirements from official venue pages.
- Before claiming award status in a paper, slide, README, or public text, verify the current official venue award page.

## Local Records

Local PDFs under `paper_ref/` are convenience copies for exemplar analysis. Treat the shared registry as the source record and the local PDFs as optional inspection artifacts. If a local PDF is missing or stale, use public source records only after respecting private-material safety from `../ccf-common/references/privacy-and-evidence.md`.
